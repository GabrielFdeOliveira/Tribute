                        He currently competes in the Lightweight division in the <strong>Ultimate Fighting Championship (UFC)</strong>, where he is a former UFC Lightweight Champion. 
                        Oliveira holds multiple UFC records, notably the most submission wins in the organization's history at 16, and most finishes at 19. As of August
                        22, 2022, he is #1 in the UFC lightweight rankings and #3 in the UFC men's pound-for-pound rankings</p>
                <h2>Early career</h2>
                    <p>Oliveira began his career in 2007 in his home country of Brazil, compiling a record of 12x0, with six knockouts and five submissions. On three 
                    separate occasions, Oliveira has compiled multiple wins on the same night.

                    His first bout was the in the amateur MMA event Circuito Nacional de Vale-Tudo Amador ("National Amateur Vale-Tudo Circuit") against Rui Machado,
                        Oliveira submitted him with an armbar 15 seconds into the first round.
                    
                    In March 2008, Oliveira made his professional debut at the Predador Fight Championship promotion, where his master Jorge Patino had previously 
                    participated at Predator FC 6. The event was the "Predator FC 9 - Welterweight Grand Prix", a one-night single-elimination tournament similar
                        to the "Grand Prix" events held by Pride FC, where the competitors would have to fight three times in order to be crowned the champion. In 
                        the first round, Oliveira defeated Jackson Pontes via submission (rear-naked choke), which advanced him to the second stage of the tournament. 
                        Oliveira's second stage fight was against Viscardi Andrade. In the second round, Oliveira won via TKO (punches) and advanced to the final round 
                        of the tournament. Oliveira won the tournament by defeating Diego Braga via TKO (punches) in the first round of the fight.</p>
                <h2>UFC Career</h2>
                    <p>In January 2010, Oliveira was named as the third-best Brazilian prospect to watch in 2010, according to Sherdog.
                    Oliveira then signed for the UFC and made his debut against Darren Elkins. Oliveira defeated Elkins via 
                    submission (armbar) after 41 seconds of the first round. After his debut, he had a series of ups and down's in his
                    career, battling with weight cuts and being questioned about his mental strength all the way until 2017 on his defeat 
                    to Paul Felder in the UFC 218. After that he's holding a series of eleven wins fight streak, defeating the biggest names in his weight class like 
                    Dustin Poirier, Justin Gaethje, Tony Fergson and Michael Chandler.</p>
